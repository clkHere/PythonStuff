<h1>Basic Queries</h1>
Queries are simply requests sent to the program to retreive specific information. The <code>SELECT</code> keyword is heavily used for that purpose.

These are some of the common and basic queries. 

<h2><code>SELECT</code> keyword</h2>

```sql 
SELECT *          -- 'Select all columns'
FROM student;     -- 'FROM the student table'
```
This returns ALL the students and their information columns: 
| student_id | name | major | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Jack | Biology | 
| 2 | Kate | Sociology | 
| 3 | Claire | Chemistry | 
| 4 | David | Psychology | 
| 5 | Chelsea | NULL | 

<u>You can also select specific columns as well</u>:

```sql
SELECT name, major
FROM studnet; 
```

Returns: 
| name | major | 
| :---: | :---: |
| Jack | Biology | 
| Kate | Sociology | 
| Claire | Chemistry | 
| David | Psychology | 
| Chelsea | NULL | 

<h2><code>ORDER BY</code> keyword</h2>
The <code>ORDER BY</code> keyword allows you to return data in a specified order, sorted alphabetically (ascending by default, but can be changed on same line):

```sql
SELECT student.name, student.major
FROM student
ORDER BY name DESC;			-- Returns names in descending order
```

The <code>ORDER BY</code> keyword acts much like a <b>sort</b> and can be used to order by multiple values with a simple use of the comma <code>,</code> on the same line: 

```sql
/*Return an ordered table with majors listed in alphabetical order and student id's listed in ascending order*/

SELECT student.name, student.major
FROM student;
ORDER BY major, student_id; 	
```

<h2><code>LIMIT</code> keyword</h2>
The <code>LIMIT</code> keyword is self-explanatory and limits the number of results you get back from the query. 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY student_id DESC
LIMIT 2;			-- Only returns 2 results
```

<h2>Filtering with <code>WHERE</code> keyword</h2>

Can combine where with comparison operators: 
<code><, >, <=, >=, =, <>, AND, OR</code>

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE major = 'Chemistry' OR name = 'Kate';

-- <, >, <=, >=, =, <>, AND, OR

SELECT name, major
FROM student
WHERE student_id <3 or major<> 'Biology';
```

  <h2>Using the <code>IN</code> keyword</h2>
  Used to find things in combination with <code>WHERE</code> keyword: 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE major IN ('Biology', 'Chemistry') and student_id > 2;
```
