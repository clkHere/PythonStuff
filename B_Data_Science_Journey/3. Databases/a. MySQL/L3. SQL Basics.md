SQL is a language used for interacting with **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**

- You can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for you
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete data (CRUD)
  - Create & manage databases
  - Design & create database tables
  - Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, etc)
- SQL implementations vary between systems
  - Not all RDBMS follow the SQL to a 'T'
  - The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary
- SQL is a hybrid language of 4 types of languages in one:
  - **Data Query Language**
    - Used to query the database for information
    - Get information that is already stored there
  - **Data Definition Language**
    - Used for defining database schemas
  - **Data Control Language**
    - Used for controlling access to the data in the database
    - User & permissions management
  - **Data Manipulation Language**
    - Used for inserting, updating, and deleting data from the database

<h1>Queries</h1>
A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written in SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you:

- TONS of data in a DB
- Often hidden in a complex schema
- Goal is to only get the data you need

  ```sql
  SELECT employee.name, employee.age 	  /*define the key/object you're looking for*/
  FROM employee 						            /*define the place you want to retreive the data frome*/
  WHERE employee.salary > 3000; 		    /*define the parameter*/
  ```
