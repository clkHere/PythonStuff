# Lesson 1: What Are Databases?

- SQL is a language which is used to interact wth relational database management systems
- A database is any collection of related information:

  - Phone book
  - Shopping list
  - To-Do list
  - Best Friends
  - Facebook User Base 

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)

  - A special software program that helps users create and maintain a Database  
    -Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information
    -Handles security
    -Backups
    -Importing/exporting database
    -Concurrency
    -Interacts with software applications
      -Programming languages

## C.R.U.D
<b>Create, Update, Update, Delete</b> <--- The four main operations of any database.

## Two Types of Databases

<b>RELATIONAL </b>

- Organizes data into one or more tables
  - Each table has columns and rows
    - A unique key identifies each row
- Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
  - Help users create and maintain a relational database
    - mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB, etc.
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
  - Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
  - Used to perform CRUD operations as well as other administrative tasks (user management, security, backup, etc). 
  - Used to define tables and structures
  - SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification

<b>NON-RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (NRDBMS)</b>

- Organizes data is anything but a traditional tables
  - Key-value stores
  - documents (JSON, XML, etc)
  - Graphs
  - Flexible Tables

- Implementation Specific
  -  Any non-relational database falls under this category, so there's no set language standard
  - Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing CRUD and administrative operations on the database. 

<h2>Databse Queries</h2>

Queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information

As the database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want. 

<u> A google search is a query</u>
