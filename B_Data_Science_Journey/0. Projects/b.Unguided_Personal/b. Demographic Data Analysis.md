<h1 align="center"> Demographic Data Analysis Project </h1>

In this project I must analyze demographic data using Pandas. 

I'm given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. Here is a sample of what the data looks like:

|    |   age | workclass        |   fnlwgt | education   |   education-num | marital-status     | occupation        | relationship   | race   | sex    |   capital-gain |   capital-loss |   hours-per-week | native-country   | salary   |
|---:|------:|:-----------------|---------:|:------------|----------------:|:-------------------|:------------------|:---------------|:-------|:-------|---------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|:-----------------|:---------|
|  0 |    39 | State-gov        |    77516 | Bachelors   |              13 | Never-married      | Adm-clerical      | Not-in-family  | White  | Male   |           2174 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  1 |    50 | Self-emp-not-inc |    83311 | Bachelors   |              13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial   | Husband        | White  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               13 | United-States    | <=50K    |

<ins><b>Using Pandas, the following questions must be answered</b></ins>:<br>
- How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
- What is the average age of men?
- What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
- What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
- What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
- What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
- What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
- What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

<h3><ins> My Approach </ins></h3>

<h5> 1. Gain Data Insights </h5>

<h5> 2. Clean The Data </h5>

<h5> 3. Deal with <code>'NULL'</code> and <code>'NaN'</code> values </h5>

<h5> 4. Store cleaned data in new DataFrame </h5>

<h5> 5. Systematically answer each prompt with appropriate DataFrame filtering and storage </h5>
