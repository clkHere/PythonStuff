<p>This repo will house the scripts I crank out for Python-related work/apps/games/etc. It will serve as a boastful attestment to my pythonic capabilities and provide structure, advice, solutions, or general satiation of curiosity to anyone seeking such things.<br><br>This section will eventually house navigation links, dedicated folders for potential employers to view my work, and well-structured notes for anyone else looking to develop their python skillset.<br><br>Ideally this repo will become an invaluable source for all things Python and assist other autodidacts in their coding adventure.<br><br>All notes, markdowns, structure, and graphics were coded by me. </p>
